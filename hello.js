Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Hello World");

console.log("")
console.log("")

/* Testing */

console.log('Hello World 2');
console.log("Hello World without semi-colon")
console.log("Number of the day is 10");
console.log("Sum of numbers 1 and 7 is not : " + 1 + 7);
console.log("Sum of numbers 1 and 7 is : " + (1 + 7));
console.log("Printing Message 1 - Hello! " + " Printing Message 2 - Yellow!");
console.log('"Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It should not be that women are the exception." - Ruth Bader Ginsburg');
console.log("Above message without use of Apostrophe.    Below message with Apostrophe.");
console.log('"Women belong in all places where decisions are being made. It \shouldn\'t be that women are the exception." - Ruth Bader Ginsburg');

/*console.log(Hello World without any quotes); Did not work, gave syntax error. */



/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
   10. K Suggestion - Try to print Poetry with line breaks, Image etc.
